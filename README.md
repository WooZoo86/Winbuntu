<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I completely prefer Linux for my daily driven OS, but that does come with some strings attached. The biggest string (or unbreakable cable for most people) is compatibility, Windows *just works* with everything from gaming to the Microsoft suite of programs (see Microsoft Office and Visual Studio).
<br>
Now, granted, with projects like [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) that gap is closing every single day, but it's still not closed. 

Winbuntu aims to completely and totally close that gap by, in short, running a Ubuntu on top of a Windows installation. Other people have figured out that you can simply run a desktop environment from a WSL terminal, but Winbuntu makes that Ubuntu DE *feel* like your desktop with program pass-though, you are able to install and run any Windows or Linux program from the same desktop. 




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The following instructions will let you get Winbuntu up and running locally

### Prerequisites
Currently the only prerequisite is that you have installed Windows 10 Personal or Professional April 2018 update or newer. There is no reason why this shouldn't work on older versions or the most recent update to LTSB, but it has not been tested or verified. 

### Installation
1. Download this repository 
2. Open a Powershell terminal as admin. The script is not able to run without admin rights.
3. Navigate to the directory location
4. Run ```powershell
.\installer.ps1```
<br>
Note regarding installation; Your computer *will* reboot multiple times during installation, this is normall and to be expected.
